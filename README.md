# Portfolio

A personal portfolio site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and TypeScript. The project showcases my work, blog articles, and includes a contact form that uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) for email delivery.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run common scripts:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

The project uses ESLint with Next.js's strict configuration. Run `pnpm lint` to check for warnings in the codebase.

The local site will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The production site is available at [https://mikechaves.io](https://mikechaves.io).

### Environment Variables

To enable email sending from the contact form, create a `.env.local` file in the project root and define `RESEND_API_KEY` with your Resend API key.

Without this variable, the form falls back to a mock implementation.

## Features

- Blog section with example posts
